rug Molecule Visualization and Analysis Tool
Overview
This tool enables researchers to visualize and analyze drug molecule data with a user-friendly interface. It provides functionalities for visualizing molecule structures and analyzing key properties. The primary features include:

Molecule Visualization:

Display molecule structures in 2D or 3D representations.
Interact with structures by zooming, rotating, and highlighting regions.
Molecule Analysis:

Present key properties like predicted binding affinity, solubility, and potential side effects.
Visualize and compare properties across multiple molecules using charts or graphs.


Technologies Used
Front-end framework: React.js
Chemical structure visualization library: 3Dmol.js
